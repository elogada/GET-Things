# GET-Things
Ways to diversify your HTTP requests.

This repo includes ways to improve your HTTP requests. The title might be a little misleading: It's not just about GET requests. These can also be applied into requests such as OPTIONS, TRACE, POST, and the like. Future commits  might include zero-days, but at the moment, it will be limited to a few (more or less) over-the-counter requests.

I will not push anything that has not been tested in a live environment nor in a wargame.
